# splatnet2statink.py

A script that uploads battle data from the SplatNet 2 app ("Nintendo Switch Online," for use with *Splatoon 2*) to [http://stat.ink/](http://stat.ink/), a site for recording, visualizing, and aggregating statistics from *Splatoon* and *Splatoon 2*.

## Usage

```
$ python splatnet2statink.py [-M [N]] [-r] [-s] [--ignore-private] [-t]
```

The `-M` flag runs the script in monitoring mode, uploading new battle results as you play games. The script checks for new battles every `N` seconds; if no `N` is provided, the script defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

The `-r` flag, for use with monitoring mode, checks to see if there are recent battle records present on SplatNet 2 that haven't been uploaded to stat.ink and, if so, posts them.

The `-s` flag suppresses uploading the scoreboard result image.

The `--ignore-private` flag suppresses uploading private matches.

The `-t` flag sends the data to stat.ink as a dry run, without uploading, for testing/validation purposes.

Note: Executing the script via `./splatnet2statink.py` is also possible on macOS or Linux. If you've downloaded a .zip of this repository using the green "Clone or download" button above (instead of via `git clone`), the script must first be made executable by running `chmod +x splatnet2statink.py`.

### Example usage

Running `python splatnet2statink.py -M 900` from the command line launches the script in monitoring mode, checking for and uploading battles every 15 minutes.

## Setup instructions

1. Download and install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (pre-installed on macOS) and the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

2. From the command line (macOS: Terminal; Windows: Command Prompt/PowerShell), install the required Python libraries:
    ```
    pip install requests
    pip install msgpack-python
    ```
    If you're on Windows with multiple versions of Python installed, you'll have to use `py -2 -m pip` instead. If the `py` command is not recognized, use `\Python27\python.exe \Python27\Scripts\pip.exe` (given you've installed Python 2.7 in the default directory).

3. Running the script for the first time will prompt you to enter your stat.ink API key, which can be found in your [profile settings](https://stat.ink/profile). If you're using the app in a language other than English, you may choose choose to enter your [language code](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/languages) (locale) as well.

4. You will then be asked to enter your `iksm_session` token. This can be obtained by following the mitmproxy instructions [here](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions). This token (used to access your SplatNet battle results) along with your stat.ink API key and language will automatically be saved into `config.txt` for you. You're now ready to upload battles!

### Accessing SplatNet 2 from your browser

If you wish to access the SplatNet site from your computer rather than via the phone app, navigate to [https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home](https://app.splatoon2.nintendo.net/home) (it should show a forbidden error). Use a cookie editor (such as [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) for Chrome) to change `iksm_session` to the value you obtained [previously](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions) (stored as  `cookie` in `config.txt`), and refresh the page. If you only wish to access SplatNet 2 and don't have a stat.ink API key, simply enter "skip" for this step during setup.

*Splatoon 2* stage rotation information (including Salmon Run) and current SplatNet gear are viewable at [https://splatoon2.ink/](https://splatoon2.ink/).
